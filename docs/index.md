!!! Abstract

    Although mutation is commonly thought of as a random process, evolutionary
    studies show that different types of nucleotide substitution occur with
    widely varying rates that presumably reflect biases intrinsic to mutation
    and repair mechanisms1,2,3,4. A strand asymmetry5,6, the occurrence of
    particular substitution types at higher rates than their complementary
    types, that is associated with DNA replication has been found in bacteria7
    and mitochondria8. A strand asymmetry that is associated with transcription
    and attributable to higher rates of cytosine deamination on the coding
    strand has been observed in enterobacteria9,10,11. Here, we describe a
    qualitatively different transcription-associated strand asymmetry in
    mammals, which may be a byproduct of transcription-coupled repair12 in
    germline cells. This mutational asymmetry has acted over long periods of
    time to produce a compositional asymmetry, an excess of G+T over A+C on the
    coding strand, in most genes. The mutational and compositional asymmetries
    can be used to detect the orientations and approximate extents of
    transcribed regions.
